### build

This directory contains a `contracts` directory (`build/contracts`), which consists of the compiled version of the smart contracts specified in the `/contracts` directory. This directory and included files are generated via `truffle compile`.

### config

This directory holds the configurations for the developer's environment used to build this project.

- `eslint/`:
  - Configures how to lint (clean and organize) the JS code
  - `.eslintignore`: ignore files that match the listed description
  - `.eslintrc.js`: describe the rules used to lint the JS code
- `postcss/`:
  - `postcss.config.js`: configures plugins for PostCSS, which enables transformation of CSS with JS 
- `vue-loader/`:
  - `vue-loader.conf.js`: configure loader (preprocess files of many different types) for webpack (bundles many `.js` files together) for Vue.js applications
  - Vue.js is a framework to build a web app's UI faster
- `webpack`:
  - `index.js`: Describes how and where to bundle the files together
  - The other files describe 3 different code environments: `dev`, `test`, and `prod`

### contracts

This directory holds the Solidity (file type and programming language) files that define the smart contracts that are used in this project.

[http://solidity.readthedocs.io](http://solidity.readthedocs.io)

- `Migrations.sol`: describes the Migration smart contract and what it can do
- `Users.sol`: describes the User smart contract and what it can do

### migrations

This directory contains files that deploy the contracts (Migrations and Users) to the Ethereum network. These files are read by `truffle migrate`.

### node_modules

### other-files

- `.editorconfig`: Describes rules for writing code (spaces, trailing commas, etc.) that can be read by many text editors
- `.gitignore`: Ignore these files when pushing code to GitHub
- `DETAILED_DOCUMENTATION.md`: Contains detailed descriptions of the directories and files in this project
- `index.html`: The home page of the browser client; initially a skeleton file that is then populated with dynamic code at runtime
- `LICENSE`: Describes the license (instructions governing use or redistribution of software) that this project is released under
- `package-lock.json`: Automaticaly generated by the `npm` CLI; contains detailed information about the dependencies needed for this project
- `package.json`: Lists the dependencies needed, along with some scripts and metadata, used to build and run this project; automatically read by the `npm` CLI
- `README.md`: Contains a high-level description of the project along with important notes
- `truffle.js`: The configuration file for Truffle; Truffle is a development environment and testing framework designed to make developing for Ethereum (blockchain-based distributed computing platform that uses smart contracts) simpler; provides tools to write, test, and deploy smart contracts

### miscellaneous

- `MetaMask Chrome extension`: turns Google Chrome into an Ethereum browser, allowing websites to retrieve data from the blockchain and allowing users to securely manage identities and sign transactions
- `RPC`: Remote Procedure Call; concept that enables one computer to call a procedure of another computer; used often in distributed computing  and blockchain communication
